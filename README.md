# WaterLevelMonitor
Automatic Water Level Monitoring System with Automatic Pump Control

This project aims to solve problems related to poor water allocation, inefficient use of water, consumption and use of unclean water, lack of adequate and integrated water management through the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) system, consisting of multiple sensors, a Global System for MobileÂ Communications (GSM) module and an arduino board, in order to monitor the level and quality of water in a tank with automatic pump switching whereby all information on the level and quality of water in the tank is displayed on a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD ) and also on an application software on your smart phone.

In this project, the water level is constantly monitored with the use of an ultrasonic sensor which ensures that there is no wastage caused by overflow of water in the tank. Automatic pump switching which turns on the pump when the water in the tank reaches a low level and turns it off when the tank is full ensures that water is always readily available for consumption while minimizing electricity wastage and saving man hour. The water level and quality data over a period of time can help the consumer know the quality and rate of consumption of water daily, which can lead to better water utilization/management.
The system uses sensors like; pH sensor, temperature sensor, turbidity sensor, to test for the quality of the water which helps the consumer know if the water is suitable for consumption. The information and readings gotten from the sensors is displayed on the smart phone of the consumer.
